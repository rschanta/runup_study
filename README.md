# Runup Study
Hi Marissa! This is your runup suite. The main.py file contains everything and is commented in a perhaps excessive fashion. It uses a miniature version of my funwave_ds suite that I adapted to just generate locally to get the input files (no cdfs) and some dataframes. It's a lot of code, but it's very compartmentalized such that I think the function names describe pretty clearly what each are doing. The function set defines the actual logic to make everything dynamically (ie- using the pi parameters, setting up the time, friction, etc). The filter sets are just conditions to explicitly exclude. The print sets define how the necessary files (ie- input.txt) get output. the setup_path function in the function sets is an important part of this, which you may want to play around with to suit your own preferences. There's just so many combinations of variables that I wasn't sure what the best way for your system would be in terms of hierarchy.
